### Desciption:
Choosing a Linux Distro can be difficult as there are a tone of options to go with. So, I made this little website. It's a Questionnaire based website that uses Machine Learning to predict the Linux Distro that will best suit you, based on your response.
It makes the choice for you and give a single best name of distro for your priorities.

### Techologies used:
The project was divided into 2 parts:
1. Machine Learning Model
2. Web Development

For Machine Learning, I worked in Python <img alt="Python" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" /> (Tensorflow <img alt="TensorFlow" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/tensorflow/tensorflow.png" />)
