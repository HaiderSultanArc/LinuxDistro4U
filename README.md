### Desciption:
Choosing a Linux Distro can be difficult as there are a tone of options to go with. So, I made this little website. It's a Questionnaire based website that uses Machine Learning to predict the Linux Distro that will best suit you, based on your response.
It makes the choice for you and give a single best name of distro for your priorities.

### Techologies used:
The project was divided into 2 parts:
1. Machine Learning Model
2. Web Development

* For Machine Learning, I worked in Python Tensorflow <img alt="TensorFlow" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/tensorflow/tensorflow.png" />
* For Web Development, I worked in ReactJS <img alt="React" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/react/react.png" /> and Firebase <img alt="Firebase" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/firebase/firebase.png" /> for hosting. I also used TensoflowJS <img alt="TensorFlow" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/tensorflow/tensorflow.png" /> to import my Tensorflow.Keras Model.

### Things I learnt:
* Synthasizing Data for Machine Learning
* Data analysis and Processing for Machine Learning
* Developing Machine Learing Solution for the Data available
* Implementing machine learing model with ReactJS Application
* Writing security script using Google Cloud Console

### TODO:

- [x] Synthesis Data for Machine Learning
- [x] Develop Machine Learning Model
- [x] Develop pages for Website
- [x] Develop Arc'ion and his Speech System
- [x] Develop Questionnaire System
- [x] Develop Input Vector From responses
- [x] Integrating Tensorflow.Keras Model into Website using TensorflowJS, host model on firebase
- [x] Host version 1.0 on Firebase
- [ ] Move Linux Distro Library and Questions to Firebase
- [ ] Re-Desgn the Response Page
- [ ] Host version 1.5 on Firebase
- [ ] Include Linux Distros that are Active for 5 or more years and can be used as Desktop
- [ ] Re-Train the Model
- [ ] Host version 2.0 on Firebase
- [ ] Include Linux Distros that are Active for 5 or more years and are special purpose
