### Desciption:
Choosing a Linux Distro can be difficult as there is a ton of options to go with. So, I made this little website. It's a Questionnaire based website that uses Machine Learning to predict the Linux Distro that will best suit you, based on your response. It makes the choice for you and gives a single best name of the distro for your priorities.

Visit Website here: [LinuxDistr4U](https://linux-distro-4u.web.app/)



### Techologies used:
The project was divided into 2 parts:
1. Machine Learning Model
  * For Machine Learning, I worked in Python Tensorflow <img alt="TensorFlow" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/tensorflow/tensorflow.png" />

2. Web Development
  * For Web Development, I worked in ReactJS <img alt="React" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/react/react.png" /> and Firebase <img alt="Firebase" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/firebase/firebase.png" /> for hosting. I also used TensoflowJS <img alt="TensorFlow" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/tensorflow/tensorflow.png" /> to import my Tensorflow.Keras Model.

### Things I learnt:
* Synthasizing Data for Machine Learning
* Data analysis and Processing for Machine Learning
* Developing Machine Learing Solution for the Data available
* Implementing machine learing model with ReactJS Application
* Writing security script using Google Cloud Console
